      <title>Lazy Evaluation with Expression Templates (2)</title>

      <description>Progress so far
Previously we have implemented lazy expressions using expression template. With expression APIs, we could seamlessly use expressions as vector and matrix. For example,
Vector a, b; auto c = add(a, b); Vector d = add(a, c);  In this example we create a addition expression of a and b, and then call add with an expression and a vector. In the second add expression, the argument c, which is a Vector, will be converted to a VectorRefExp.</description>

      <description>In last post I talked about the ongoing refactor of linalg. So we are going to have untemplated vector and matrix types, using a void pointer and checking type information in runtime. Say you have some vectors and do some computations like
Vector a, b, c; c = add(add(a, b), c);  A simple idea is to switch over element types of vectors and call templated routine linalg::add&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;. In this way we will have to switch every time, over each expression involved, e.</description>

      <description>So in the next two weeks I&amp;rsquo;m going to work on refactoring linalg of Shogun. The data types in Shogun, SGVector&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, SGMatrix&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; are templated classes which maintain a piece of memory in either CPU or GPU and provide basic operations like array-like element access. linalg::, is the upper level module working with SGVector, SGMatrix, providing linalg algebra operations, like matrix additions / multiplications.
Though SGVector and SGMatrix, as template classes, are capable to represent different data types (float32_t, float64_t, etc.</description>

      <title>New Transformers in Shogun</title>

      <description>The first two weeks of GSoC have ended. Here I will share my progress so far.
In the first two weeks, I have been mostly working on the new transformer class, CTransformer. It is introduced mainly for two purposes: 1) Providing generic and unified interface for data transformation. 2) Make features immutable.
In Shogun, we have preprocessors and converters, both operating on features and applying some transformations. The major distinction between them I think is that preprocessors support on-the-fly evaluation: we can add several preprocessors by add_preprocessor and then apply them when calling get_feature_vector.</description>

      <title>GSoC&#39;18: Overview</title>

      <description>Projects of GSoC&amp;rsquo;18 were announced last week and I am happy that I will be working on Shogun over this summer. In this post, I am pleased to share some details of my project.
Shogun is a versatile machine learning toolbox that offers a bunch of convinent and unified algorithm implementations. Written in C++ and providing interface in different languages via SWIG, it is a great place to hack.</description>
