Hi, I am Wuwei Lin. 
I'm a master student at [Carnegie Mellon University](Carnegie Mellon University).
I received my bachelor's degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn), [School of Software](http://en.se.sjtu.edu.cn).
I am an active contributor and committer to [TVM](https://tvm.ai), with primary focus on quantized CUDA operators and Relay.
I worked on [Shogun](http://shogun.ml) in [GSoC 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/6031654070517760/), for
refactoring and redesigning transformers, feature representation and linalg, aimed at modernizing the long-historied machine learning toolbox and making it easy to use.
