Hi, I am Wuwei Lin. I'm a undergraduate junior student in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn). My research interests include computer vision and machine learning. Currently, I am a research assistant in [Machine Vision Intelligence Group](http://mvig.sjtu.edu.cn) by Prof. [Cewu Lu](http://mvig.sjtu.edu.cn/). I will work for [Shogun](http://shogun.ml) this summer as a GSoC 2018 student.
